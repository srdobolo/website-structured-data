# website-structured-data
For your recruitment agency website, in addition to the jobPosting schema for the Job Offers page, here are some other schema types that can enhance the SEO and user experience on each page:

### Home Page: Use WebPage or Organization schema to represent your agencyâ€™s online presence.
Example: Include Organization schema to provide structured information about your agency, such as its name, logo, contact details, and a description. You can embed this information in the WebPage schema to represent the homepage itself.

### Services Page: Service schema would be ideal for detailing the specific recruitment and support services you offer.
Example: Create separate Service entries for headhunting, permanent placement, onboarding support, and consultation services, each with descriptions, pricing (if applicable), and other relevant details.

### About Us Page: AboutPage schema along with Organization can provide structured data about your company, its history, mission, and values.
Example: The AboutPage schema can describe the page's purpose, and the Organization schema can list details about the company and its partners.

### Contact Us Page: Use the ContactPage schema along with ContactPoint to provide contact information.
Example: Include ContactPoint to give details like phone numbers, email, and business hours. Specify different contact points if you offer multiple support channels, such as a general inquiries contact versus a candidate support contact.

Incorporating these schemas will make your site more accessible to search engines and improve its visibility in search results.
